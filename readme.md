## RootsPlus â€“ Smart Agriculture Platform

---

## Project Overview

**RootsPlus** is a proposed idea for an agricultural company that is interested in technology or wants to move towards digital transformation. The company has many agronomists who follow up on the farming activities of the farms connected to it. For each farm, they create activities, evaluations, and reports. The farm owner can view these updates regularly and stay informed.

- **Admin:** Possesses full administrative access, allowing for the management of users, farms, and all system-wide settings.


## Key Features
