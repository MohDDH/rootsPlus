## RootsPlus â€“ Smart Agriculture Platform

---

## Project Overview

**RootsPlus** is a proposed concept for an agricultural technology company dedicated to transforming farm management. The platform is designed to bridge the gap between farmers and agronomists by providing **smart tools, actionable insights,** and a supportive ecosystem to promote agricultural success. Its core mission is to make farming smarter, more sustainable, and more profitable by connecting expert agricultural knowledge with real-world farming needs.

## Main Roles

RootsPlus supports a multi-tiered user structure, with access and functionality tailored for specific roles:

- **Farmer:** Users can register farms, manage crop cycles, and receive targeted recommendations for their agricultural operations.
- **Agronomist:** Expert users who can supervise multiple linked farms, log field activities, and provide detailed evaluations and seasonal guidance.
- **Admin:** Possesses full administrative access, allowing for the management of users, farms, and all system-wide settings.

## Core Modules

The platform is built around several interconnected modules designed to cover the full spectrum of farm management:

- **Farm Management:** Functionality for adding, modifying, and associating farms with specific users.
- **Crop Tracking:** Allows for the recording of detailed crop information, including planting dates, cultivated areas, and expected yields.
- **Activity Logging:** A mechanism to track and log various agricultural activities, such as irrigation scheduling, fertilization applications, pest control measures, and harvesting operations.
- **Evaluations and Reports:** Enables expert agronomists to submit formal farm evaluations and issue seasonal recommendations.
- **Dashboard:** Provides a summarized view of key performance indicators, data visualizations (charts), and statistics tailored to the respective user role.
- **Authentication:** Manages role-based login, security, and user session management.
